% \subsection{Data Gathering}
% For the data gathering of the raw point cloud, all the major hardware of the system will be assemble and integrate as shown in Figure \ref{ch3:fig:System Hardware Block Diagram}. The scanned data from the 2D LiDAR sensor will be received by small computer which is Raspberry Pi for the processing of the raw data. This small computer is connected to the internet in order to control remotely by the personal laptop. Different scanning procedure will be performed to gather point cloud data.

% \end{figure}

\subsection{Software Development}
\label{ch3:sec:firmware_development_design}

Software development plays a crucial role in the overall development of the 3D Point Cloud Scanner System by facilitating communication between hardware components, and allows connection with external software system. The system was designed to initialize all necessary components, including nodes and connection, immediately upon power-up. This ensures seamless operation and also establish connection with the developed web application for user interaction. As described in figure \ref{ch3:fig:software_system_process}, after turning on the system, it initializes essential nodes and enter in idle mode waiting for an external command coming from the web application. The system remain in idle mode unless turnoff. The development of software processes, including the choice of operating system and frameworks is outlined in this section.

Throughout this study, it's important to note that the terms 'process' and 'nodes' are used interchangeably. This interchangeable usage highlights the fundamental concept in ROS where processes, represented as nodes, perform computation and communication tasks within the system.

	\caption{System Idle Mode Process Flow Chart}
	\label{ch3:fig:software_system_process}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Operating System and Frameworks}

In this study, the single-board computer (SBC) used in the 3D-PCSS requires an appropriate OS and frameworks to support the execution of firmware and software components. Linux-based operating systems, such as Ubuntu, is commonly chosen for SBCs due to its reliability, flexibility, and extensive community support. This OS option provide a stable platform for running Robot Operating System (ROS) nodes and managing system resources effectively, thus, was utilized in this study. ROS framework was also utilized in this study to develop a publish-subscribe relationship between ROS nodes. Lastly, Point Cloud Library (PCL) serves in this study as a fundamental library being used for processing and analyzing point cloud data. PCL provides a comprehensive set of algorithms and tools for tasks such as point cloud registration, filtering and computational geometry to name a few.

\subsubsection{Startup Initialization Process}
Roscore and rosgridge are the two essential cores that used in the software of 3D-PCSS. These cores or nodes typically need to be executed manually through the command-line interface (CLI) or desktop environment terminal to run and process data, or to initiate other nodes and do specific tasks. However, it is impractical to start and stop this nodes each time the system is turn on or off, thus, in this study a custom service file was developed to automate and start these nodes after the system is turn on. This file is created using Linux systemd to configure and instantly run the cores.

% The Raspberry Pi will receive the scanned raw data coming from the 3D point cloud scanner. This data will be processed in different stages to produced desired output, such as point cloud pre-processing (formatting, converting, clustering, and cleansing) and post-processing (e.g., 3D mapping and volume measurement). Various platforms and frameworks nowadays are available to ease the handling of these massive raw data, thus, formatting the data to a desired platform must be perform. Typically, the value of raw data coming from the LiDAR sensor is not directly a point cloud data but rather a value of the distance between the sensor and the reflected nearest object in a particular direction, therefore, the data is converted into point cloud which composed of x, y, and z values. The Equation \eqref{ch3:eq:x-point}, \eqref{ch3:eq:y-point}, and \eqref{ch3:eq:z-point} is conversion of polar coordinates (distance, angle) to cartesian coordinates x, y, and z, respectively, in a 3D coordinate system.

% \begin{equation}
% 	x_{point_{i}} = \ \sin(i) \times d \
% 	\label{ch3:eq:x-point}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% 	y_{point_{i}} = \ \cos(\pi) \times \cos(i) \times d \
% 	\label{ch3:eq:y-point}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% 	z_{point_{i}} = \ -\cos(i) \times \sin(\pi) \times d \
% 	\label{ch3:eq:z-point}
% \end{equation}

% Where:

% \indent \indent i = scan angle of the scanner

% \indent \indent d = the distance point of the emitted pulse by the LiDAR (meter)

\subsubsection{System Scanning and LiDAR Range Values Processes}
As described in conceptual framework that can be shown in figure \ref{fig:conceptual-framework}, the system is placed at the top of the storage bin. Once the system receive a command from the web application, it will start scanning the inside of the storage bin and acquiring ranges values from the LiDAR as discussed in figure \ref{ch3:fig:software_system_process} else the system enters idle mode. The study developed a ros nodes that handle different processes such as initialization of the LiDAR device and servo motor, establishing a publish-subscribe relationship between these devices, and the conversion of LiDAR range scan data to point cloud data. The raw scan data from the LiDAR are typically range values of the return pulses. These range values enters different stages of pre-processes to be mapped in two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space to create a point cloud data and use for further post-processing. The flow of the processes from initialization to mapped point cloud data is illustrated in this figure \ref{ch3:fig:scanning-to-pc-flow-chart} The method used in this study for processing the ranges values gathered from the LiDAR device is described in the figure \ref{ch3:fig:point_cloud_conversion}.  $\rho$ translates to the distance from the origin $(0,0,0)$, which is the in our case the LiDAR, and this distance is measured as meter. The angle $\theta$ is the rotation around the z-axis in the xy-plane. The angle $\phi$ is the tilt of the radius vector from the positive z-axis, it goes from 0 degree at the positive z-axis down to 90 degree at the xy-plane and all the way down to 180 degree on the negative z-axis. Equation \ref{ch3:eq:x}, \ref{ch3:eq:y} and \ref{ch3:eq:z} shows the X, Y, and Z conversion formula respectively.

\subsubsection{Point Cloud Data to Measured Volume}
\label{ch3:sec:Volume Estimation}
An Empty-space approached was used to measured the flour materials inside the storage bin. A simple representation of an empty-space approach is done following the concept discussed in section \ref{intro:sec:Conceptual Framework} where the 3D point cloud scanner system is place at the top of the storage bin to scan the empty space and generate point cloud data,  these point cloud data is process to calculate the the empty space volume using Convex Hull method. Theoretically, as shown in the equation \ref{ch4:eq:volume}, the volume of the flour materials is determined by subtracting the empty space volume from the bin's maximum volume capacity as it is also a commonly used method in these studies \citet{raba2020,clar2022}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{ch4:eq:volume}
	V_f = V_{max} - V_{empty}
\end{equation}

\begin{align*}
	 & \text{Where:}    &                                          \\
	 & V_f              & : \text{Volume of the flour materials}   \\
	 & V_{\text{max}}   & : \text{Total volume of the flour bin}   \\
	 & V_{\text{empty}} & : \text{Volume of the empty space}     &
\end{align*}

\subsection{Communication Protocol}
The flow of the connection of the web application connecting to the 3D Point Cloud Scanner System is presented in the figure \ref{ch3:fig:web_app_connection}. The system and the web application is within the same local network, after entering the local and port address in the web app, the web socket connection can be established and can send command to the system.

	\caption{Web Application Connection Process Flow Chart}
	\label{ch3:fig:web_app_connection}
\end{figure}

The web-based interface and 3D Point Cloud Scanner System utilizes WebSocket communication protocol. This communication uses full-duplex channels to establish over a single TCP connection. It allows for less latency than typical HTTP connections when a client and server interact. Within the framework of ROS applications, WebSocket enables bi-directional, real-time communication, enabling servers to rapidly transmit updates to clients. The figure \ref{ch3:fig:websocket-connection} demonstrate the initialization of the Websocket communication between the web interface and the 3D-PCSS. The following step to establish this communication is explain below:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{The Client Makes a Request:} The WebSocket client initiates the handshake by sending an HTTP request to the server.
	\item \textbf{The Server Accepts the Request:} If the server is willing to establish a WebSocket connection, it responds with an HTTP response that has a status code of 101 (Switching Protocols).
	\item \textbf{WebSocket Connection Established:} Once both the client and server have exchanged their handshake messages, the WebSocket connection is established. Data can now flow bidirectionally between the client and server over the single TCP connection.
\end{enumerate}

Before conducting the test, the actual total volume of flour storage bin was manually measured and calculated based on its actual geometric shapes and dimensions, this was done by using a measuring tool like steel tape measure. By comparing the system's measured volume with the actual total volume of the storage bin, the baseline of its performance and accuracy in measuring the total volume of the flour bin could be identified. This baseline served as a reference point for subsequent testing.

\subsubsection{Test Case 2: Filling the Storage Bin with Known Volume}
\label{ch3:subsec:test-case-2}

The second test case involved filling the flour storage bin to various percentages of its total maximum volume. To accurately measure the volume of flour materials added to the bin, a container with a known volume was used for filling. This ensured precise quantification of the added flour for comparison with the system's measurements.

The following three specific percentage level of the bin were filled scanned by the system:

%Each with different percentages of the storage bin's maximum capacity, along with known volumes and conducted a two different flour surface contour:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The storage bin was filled up to 5.8\% of its maximum capacity, with a known volume of 0.0594 cubic meters.
	\item The storage bin was filled up to 47.2\% of its maximum capacity, with a known volume of 0.4752 cubic meters.
	\item The storage bin was filled up to 70.37\% of its maximum capacity, with a known volume of 0.7128 cubic meters.
\end{enumerate}

The test comprised of 5 multiple scans for each of the two different surface contours, totaling 10 scans per test scenario. The objective was to assess the system's performance and measurement accuracy at different fill levels. Additionally, scanning with different surface contours aimed to evaluate the consistency of the system's measurements for same volumes value but different surface contour.

%These different test cases were designed to assess the accuracy and performance of the overall system.

% These test cases were crucial in evaluating the accuracy and performance of the system under different conditions.

% Testing \ref{ch3:second} will be evaluated from the testing \ref{ch3:first} based on the number of point cloud acquired of both testing, and compare it. Basically, the testing \ref{ch3:second} will acquired more point cloud compared to testing \ref{ch3:first} due to multi-echo or multiple returning from the dust and the flour bin.

% In testing \ref{ch3:third} and \ref{ch3:fourth}, the researcher will place flour materials inside the bin with different surface shape and perform volume estimation. After the volume estimation, the researcher will generate dust, scan the bin, perform volume estimation and compare it to the result of the testing \ref{ch3:third}.

\subsection{System Evaluation}
To evaluate the system's performance and measured volume based on the test methods, a comparative analysis was conducted between the actual volume and the measured volume obtained during the testing.

The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was used to identify the average percentage difference between the measured volume of the system relative to the actual volume. This method would suggest how closely the system's measurements align with the actual values.

Standard Deviation (SD) was also used to identify the dispersion of the system's measured volume. The observation of SD suggests how clustered the measurement of the system.  Overall, these statistical tools were essential for evaluating system's accuracy and precision in measuring the volume relative to the actual volume.
