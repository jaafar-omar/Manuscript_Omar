\section{Background of the Study}
\label{intro:sec:Background of the Study}
The products stored within the voluminous storage units of food manufacturing industries, commonly referred to as silos, are crucial assets that require careful monitoring and assessment the volume. Typically, this assessment is conducted from the opening door at the top of the silo, where the product is loaded, using a fiberglass tape measurement. This measurement provides a single data point representing the distance between the product and the door. However, this single point is not enough to accurately measure the volume as the product may form uneven surface during loading and unloading \citep{turner2016}. Therefore, it is ideal to collect more data points to enhance the measurement accuracy. 

Extending upon the concept of gathering multiple data points, three-dimensional points, often abbreviated as 3D points, constitute a set of data points that depict positions within three-dimensional space by means of their coordinates in the x, y, and z axes. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is one of the many devices that can gather 3D points that often refer as point clouds. Unfortunately, commercial 3D LiDAR systems tend to be expensive in comparison to their 2D-based LiDAR. This cost disparity can lead to limitations in accessibility for certain applications or industries, hindering widespread adoption and innovation in fields where 3D spatial data is crucial. Low-cost two axes-based LiDAR can mimic the collection of 3D point cloud by adding an additional axes using tilting device \citep{clar2022}. However, it comes with a notable drawback: it lacks several capabilities present in high-end 3D LiDAR systems, including multi-echo functionality, long-range detection, high angular resolution, among others.

%Recent innovations in various industries have made the production less manual but producing more by using automation and wireless technologies that helped to produce better and accurate measurement compared to traditional methods and addressed the problem mentioned above \citep{wang2020}. These approaches include various sensing technologies, automated measurements, machine to machine (M2M) communications, and monitoring systems. The interconnected sensors and actuators allow to remotely collect data, store, and process the data to provide better insight in the industry and also for the economic growth. \citet{bulut2020} specify the characteristics of a paperless factory, it is a development of a smart factory in which all data that is turned into information is stored, transferred, and displayed entirely remotely and digitally. As the level of digitization of a smart factory, it is not a revolution but rather an evolution.

Although laser  technology have been proved to be useful and excellent in various field compared to other technology with in terms of its capabilities, features, and accuracy, however, it produced undesirable or no data when the environment is exposed to dust or fog the blocks the visibility of the object interest \citep{yigit2015,turner2017,duysak2020}. With the given circumstances, todays commercial high-end LiDAR still gather relevant data to analyze using multi-echo functionality and some hardware improvement which, unfortunately, lacks on low-cost LiDAR.

\section{Statement of the Problem}
\label{intro:sec:Statement of the Problem}
%A variety of product that stored in a silo can be solid, powdered and liquid. When the product such as solid grains, corn are being stored, minimal dust cloud are generated during filling process. However, when powdered products such as cement or flour are being filled, a dense dust cloud are created. Ideally, when LiDAR is used for measuring the distance between the product and the door, it is installed at the top. Due to the fine-texture of solid materials such as flour product, a dispersed dust cloud may form during the pneumatic conveying process of loading flour into the bin \citep{williams2007}. Although LiDAR sensor have the ability to provide faster data collection and detailed spatial illustration compared to other sensing technologies, and the precision of distance measurement is undeniable, the wavelengths that LiDAR operates, typically, 700 to 900 nm can be problematic when deposit layers of dust formed caused by stored product as it may caused a problem when scanning the spatial structure of the product.

While some food manufacturing industries still rely on manual and labor-intensive storage measurement procedures, there is a growing need to adopt advanced technologies with remote capabilities. This shift aims to eliminate the need for frequent physical processes that may endanger employees. Silo storage systems are versatile, accommodating a wide range of products, including solids, powders, and liquids. One characteristic of silos is that when they are filled with raw materials, except for liquids, they create a dust cloud in the empty space. Solid grains like corn typically produce minimal dust clouds during filling, whereas powdered substances like cement or flour often generate dense dust clouds.

When implementing LiDAR for storage volume measurement, the ideal placement is at the top of the silo. However, in the case of fine-textured solid materials such as flour, dispersed dust clouds may arise during the pneumatic conveying process of loading flour into the bin \citep{williams2007}. Although LiDAR sensors offer advantages such as rapid data collection and precise spatial representation compared to alternative sensing technologies, their operational wavelengths—usually between 700 to 900 nm—can pose challenges when scanning through layers of dust deposited by stored products. This challenge may potentially impact the accuracy of spatial structure scans.

This study presents the development of a 3D point cloud scanner system for volume measurement of flour storage. The system is designed to be controlled and scanned remotely, alleviating the manual process of volume measurement. Additionally, this study investigates the behavior of the system when dust clouds are present during filling.

%There are various advanced LiDAR technologies such as 3D LiDAR sensors that are available in the market, primarily used for robotics applications, that can address these problems without the need of additional hardware and software configuration. However such sensing devices are too expensive and sophisticated. The focus of this study is to utilized low-cost LiDAR technology to partially mimic the sophisticated functionality of the above mentioned technology.

\section{Objectives of the Study}

\section{Originality of the Study}
\label{intro:sec:Originality of the Study}
The originality of the study lies in the development of a volume estimation and processing method for 3D point cloud data in flour bins. By utilizing 3D point cloud data obtained through remote sensing technology, the success of this study may yield a significant result for an efficient and accurate method for volume measurement and 3D point cloud processing, especially in environments with dusty conditions.

The contribution of this study to the existing body of knowledge is substantial in addressing the challenges faced by the food sector manufacturing industry. Additionally, it fills a knowledge gap in the context of achieving the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

\section{Scope and Limitations}
\label{intro:sec:Scope and Limitations}
The scope of this study is to develop a volume estimation system through the acquisition and processing of three-dimensional point cloud data obtained from a flour bin. The research involves the collection of 3D point cloud data while considering the real-world challenges posed by the presence of dust within the bin. Specifically, this study will concentrate on the estimation of the volume of flour material contained within the bin by leveraging three-dimensional point cloud data processing techniques.

This research is designed with a particular focus on flour materials as the primary subject. The limitation of this study is that it exclusively utilizes flour as the raw product for volume estimation.

\section{Significance of the Study}
\label{intro:sec:Significance of the Study}
Accurate measurement of the contents of flour bins is vital in the food industry to ensure efficient inventory management and maintain an adequate supply of materials. LiDAR technology, which captures three-dimensional data, is commonly used to represent scanned objects or environments in a 3D space. However, when flour is involved, dust clouds can form inside the bin during scanning, potentially leading to inaccurate data from the 3D point cloud scanner. Such inaccuracies can impact subsequent processing of the point cloud data. Therefore, the findings of this study hold significance in several key areas:

\begin{description}
	\item[Industrial Automation:] This study utilizes remote sensing technology, specifically LiDAR, to automate the volume estimation process for flour bins. The developed method has the potential to reduce the need for manual measurements, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of volume measurements in industrial settings.

	\item[Point Cloud Processing:] The study focuses on the development of an automated volume measurement method for flour bins based on 3D point cloud data. A point cloud is a collection of data points in a 3D space, obtainable using various sensors like LiDAR. The study's central contribution lies in its processing of the point cloud, a critical step that involves manipulating, analyzing, and interpreting 3D point cloud data. The results of this study will enrich the field of knowledge related to point cloud processing techniques, benefiting industries beyond just flour bin volume estimation.

\section{Theoretical Framework}
\label{intro:sec:Theoretical Framework}
The research is based on the idea of using automation for industrial operations, specifically in the food industry. Point cloud data is a collection of an unorganized set of x, y, and z coordinates in a three-dimensional space. There are various ways to acquire point cloud data, and one possible way is through active non-contact sensing technology such as LiDAR sensor. LiDAR uses Time-of-Flight (TOF) method of measuring distance between the sensor to the object. TOF scanners are inexpensive compared to other specialized 3D scanners \citep{chua2017}. The researcher will utilize LiDAR to acquire 3D point cloud data because of its ability to gather points data and converts them into a global world coordinate frame \citep{bi2021}. The study does, however, acknowledge the potential limits of LiDAR, when the environment is prone to medium (e.g., water vapor, gases, dust particle, etc.) that can obstruct the target surface, the LiDAR acquired point cloud data that may alter the precision of the data \citep{chua2017}. Thus, the researcher will manage the raw point cloud data by filtering the factoring medium such as dust. Lastly, Delaunay Triangulation is a computational geometry computation that connects a set points to form a mesh of triangles. It can be used for volume estimation by calculating the volume of a convex hull which will be use in this study.
