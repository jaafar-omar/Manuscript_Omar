Agricultural grains are biological materials that interact with their immediate environment. They must be stored, transported, and conveyed using methods that preserve their quality as seeds, food stuffs, or raw materials. Storage can occur either on farm or at large commercial off-farm facilities. Storage can be for varying lengths of time ranging from short-term storage
in which grain is stored while only drying takes place, to waiting some period after drying for advantageous market conditions, to long-term storage for strategic reserves.
Commercial grain storage facilities are often located in grain producing areas, at mills and other processing facilities, at grain handling terminals located at railroad centers and at ports. Commercial grain bins are typically much larger than bins used on-farm. At these facilities reinforced concrete cylinders are commonly used although large metal grain bins are also now becoming much more common. Flat storage is also seen at commercial facilities in which the grain is stored in warehouses or in piles for short-term storage.
