  abstract       = {LiDAR sensors have played an important role in a variety of related applications due to their merits of providing high-resolution and accurate information about the environment. However, their detection performance significantly degrades under dusty conditions, thereby making the whole perception of the vehicles prone to failure. To deal with this problem, we designed a de-dust filter using a LIOR filtering technique that offers a viable method of eliminating dust particles from the measurement data. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is robust in the face of dust particles by successfully removing them from the measured point cloud with good filtering accuracy while maintaining rich information about the environment.},

  abstract       = {Although the LiDAR sensor provides high-resolution point cloud data, its performance degrades when exposed to dust environments, which may cause a failure in perception for robotics applications. To address this issue, our study designed an intensity-based filter that can remove dust particles from LiDAR data in two steps. In the first step, it identifies potential points that are likely to be dust by using intensity information. The second step involves analyzing the point density around selected points and removing them if they do not meet the threshold criterion. To test the proposed filter, we collected experimental data sets under the existence of dust and manually labeled them. Using these data, the de-dusting performance of the designed filter was evaluated and compared to several types of conventional filters. The proposed filter outperforms the conventional ones in achieving the best performance with the highest F1 score and removing dust without sacrificing the original surrounding data.},

  abstract       = {By moving a commercial 2D LiDAR, 3D maps of the environment can be built, based on the data of a 2D LiDAR and its movements. Compared to a commercial 3D LiDAR, a moving 2D LiDAR is more economical. A series of problems need to be solved in order for a moving 2D LiDAR to perform better, among them, improving accuracy and real-time performance. In order to solve these problems, estimating the movements of a 2D LiDAR, and identifying and removing moving objects in the environment, are issues that should be studied. More specifically, calibrating the installation error between the 2D LiDAR and the moving unit, the movement estimation of the moving unit, and identifying moving objects at low scanning frequencies, are involved. As actual applications are mostly dynamic, and in these applications, a moving 2D LiDAR moves between multiple moving objects, we believe that, for a moving 2D LiDAR, how to accurately construct 3D maps in dynamic environments will be an important future research topic. Moreover, how to deal with moving objects in a dynamic environment via a moving 2D LiDAR has not been solved by previous research.},

  abstract  = {As agriculture has grown in scale and farmers learned to produce crops in quantities larger than the amounts needed for their immediate use, the need for methods to store and transport large quantities of grain developed. Because agricultural grains are biological materials that interact with their immediate environment they must be stored, transported, and conveyed using methods that preserve their quality as seeds, food stuffs, or raw materials. Proper management throughout the harvesting, cleaning, drying, conveying, and storage processes maintains grain in its proper state for use. Grain is often harvested at a moisture content that is too high for safe storage. Drying is the most common post-harvest process performed for the long-term preservation of grain. Grain quality is significantly affected by the drying process and type of dryer. Various numerical models have been developed to simulate the drying process of agricultural grains based on either heat and mass balances or systems of differential equations. Grain is stored in round bins, piles, and flat storage structures. Like all structures, grain bins and buildings storing agricultural grains are designed to resist various combinations of loads without exceeding the appropriate limit states of the materials of construction. Storage facilities for agricultural grains are designed based on the assumption that grain is a free flowing material and the analysis of their physical behavior overlaps with many aspects of soil mechanics. Numerous design codes exist which can be used to estimate the loads exerted by grain on bins. These loads are a function not only of the conditions of the grain being stored but also the type of storage that is being used. In almost all grain facilities grain must be moved throughout the facility from one operation to another. A key design element of any grain handling system is to specify the desired processing rate between delivery and receiving stations. Grain handling can be done by chutes, screw conveyors, belt conveyors, and pneumatic conveyors. Each of which have their own design criteria. To maintain grain quality grain is often cleaned as well using many different processes. To understand more the behavior of grains the properties of grains and grain in bulk are often tested. There are many testers for measuring flow properties of particulate systems. Most of these testers are adaptations of direct shear test devices used in soil mechanics by civil engineers. The major difference is that the size of the grain particles presents unique test conditions much different than soils. Modeling of grain and grain in bulk is done using both analytical and computational techniques. These analytical and computer models are much different than the empirical techniques which have been used over the last 100 years to design bins.}

In this brief, a set of computational geometry methods are presented and evaluated for orchard characterization; in particular, for the estimation of canopy volume and shape in groves and orchards using a LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) sensor mounted on an agricultural service unit. The proposed approaches were evaluated and validated in the field, showing they are convergent in the estimation process and that they are able to estimate the crown volume for fully scanned canopies in real time; for partially observed tree crowns, accuracy decreases up to 30% (the worst case). The latter is the major contribution of this brief since it implies that the automated service unit does not need to cover all alley-ways for an accurate modeling of the orchard, thus saving valuable resources.}

However, there are many different data formats in the market, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, with STereoLithography (STL) being the de facto file format standard. These three-dimensional (3D) model data are obtained either through computer-aided design (CAD) or 3D scanning. Depending on the scanning resolution, parts that are scanned may not be good for direct AM fabrication, requiring the user to repair or patch the model to a satisfactory standard before printing. The user has to understand the importance of ensuring that the parts that are scanned and printed consist of the features that are of crucial importance. A poor selection of slicing parameters may result in loss of features while over conservative slicing parameters will result in a longer printing time. In the medical industry, scanning involves using radiation to study the anatomy of the human body. These images are two-dimensional (2D) in nature, which may not carry enough information. Multiple images are taken and stacked together to form 3D models of the human anatomy.}

Thanks to the constituted stepped frequency continuous wave radar (SFCWR) system on a model silo, the back-scattering signal of different amount of grain for different stack structure were obtained. To create the training data, 5680 measurements were performed, and accuracy of the KNN was obtained with k-fold cross validation technique. Range profiles were obtained taking the inverse Fourier transform of SFCWR data and 8 features were extracted from range profiles. To found best feature combination on classification, 255 possible feature combinations were also constituted, then they were trained and tested. The best accuracy was achieved as 96,71% by using selected 5 features. These results show that, if the effective features are extracted from range profiles, the amount of the grain can be successfully determined using machine learning techniques.}

  abstract = {Construction and mining require high levels of planning and productivity. Planning and management of operational targets and performance requires taking into account several variables, among which the amount of moved, loaded and unloaded material is one the main ones. This motivates the development of an approach for the estimation of the volume of material transported in field operations by loader trucks. The proposed methodology employs a three-dimensional point cloud representation of the volume and is tested using a skid-steer loader. The volume estimation process involves the segmentation of the loader's bucket from the raw point cloud using machine learning techniques. The segmented point cloud is associated with a pre-constructed reference model of the empty bucket. The volume is computed from a surface model built using the alpha shape algorithm applied to the Delaunay triangulation of the segmented point cloud. Several field experiments were carried out using a stereo camera for five different volumes of material and the bucket at different heights. A 95% accuracy was obtained on average. The encouraging results suggest that effective volume estimation for different bucket types would be possible using the proposed methodology.}

  abstract = {Topological/metric route following, also called teach and repeat (T\&R), enables long-range autonomous navigation even without globally consistent localization. In the teach pass, the robot is driven manually and builds up a topological/metric map of the environment, a graph of metric submaps connected by relative transformations. For repeating the route autonomously, the map only needs to be locally consistent; errors on the global level due to localization drift are irrelevant. This renders T\&R ideal for applications in which a global positioning system may not be available, such as navigation through street canyons or forests in search and rescue, reconnaissance in underground structures, surveillance, or planetary exploration. We present a T\&R system based on iterative closest point matching (ICP) using data from a spinning three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner. Our algorithm is highly accurate, robust to dynamic scenes and extreme changes in the environment, and independent of ambient lighting. It enables autonomous navigation along a taught path in both structured and unstructured environments, including highly 3D terrain. Furthermore, our system is able to detect obstacles and avoid them by adapting its path using a local motion planner. It enables autonomous route following in nonstatic environments, which is not possible with classical T\&R systems. We demonstrate our algorithm's performance in two long-range driving experiments, one in a highly dynamic urban environment, the other in unstructured, rough, 3D terrain. In these experiments, our robot autonomously drove a distance of over 22 km in both day and night. We analyze the localization accuracy of our system and show that it is highly precise. Moreover, we compare our ICP-based method to a state-of-the-art stereo-vision-based technique and show that our approach has a greatly increased robustness to path deviations and is less dependent on environmental conditions.},

              Strengthen Food Security in Developing Countries},
  author   = {Kumar, Deepak and Kalita, Prasanta},
  abstract = {While fulfilling the food demand of an increasing population
              remains a major global concern, more than one-third of food is
              lost or wasted in postharvest operations. Reducing the
              postharvest losses, especially in developing countries, could be
              a sustainable solution to increase food availability, reduce
              pressure on natural resources, eliminate hunger and improve
              farmers' livelihoods. Cereal grains are the basis of staple food
              in most of the developing nations, and account for the maximum
              postharvest losses on a calorific basis among all agricultural
              commodities. As much as 50\%-60\% cereal grains can be lost
              during the storage stage due only to the lack of technical
              inefficiency. Use of scientific storage methods can reduce these
              losses to as low as 1\%-2\%. This paper provides a comprehensive
              literature review of the grain postharvest losses in developing
              countries, the status and causes of storage losses and discusses
              the technological interventions to reduce these losses. The
              basics of hermetic storage, various technology options, and their

However, the feasibility of the canopy reconstruction method based on point clouds has not been confirmed with these canopies. Therefore, LiDAR point cloud data for C. grandis var. Longanyou were obtained to facilitate the management of groves of this species. Then, a cloth simulation filter and European clustering algorithm were used to realize individual canopy extraction. After calculating canopy height and width, canopy reconstruction and volume calculation were realized using six approaches: by a manual method and using five algorithms based on point clouds (convex hull, CH; convex hull by slices; voxel-based, VB; alpha-shape, AS; alpha-shape by slices, ASBS). ASBS is an innovative algorithm that combines AS with slices optimization, and can best approximate the actual canopy shape. Moreover, the CH algorithm had the shortest run time, and the R2 values of VCH, VVB, VAS, and VASBS algorithms were above 0.87. The volume with the highest accuracy was obtained from the ASBS algorithm, and the CH algorithm had the shortest computation time. In addition, a theoretical but preliminarily system suitable for the calculation of the canopy volume of C. grandis var. Longanyou was developed, which provides a theoretical reference for the efficient and accurate realization of future functional modules such as accurate plant protection, orchard obstacle avoidance, and biomass estimation.},

DTVC does not preserve the Delaunay triangles but directly calculates the volume in the process of triangulation. It saves memory and running time. Experimental results show that DTVC has achieved a good balance between error and efficiency.},

  abstract       = {The calculation of volumes for irregular bodies holds significant relevance across various production processes. This spans tasks such as evaluating the growth status of crops and fruits, conducting morphological analyses of spatial objects based on volume parameters, and estimating quantities for earthwork and excavation. While methods like drainage, surface reconstruction, and triangulation suffice for smaller irregular bodies, larger ones introduce heightened complexity. Technological advancements, such as UAV photogrammetry and LiDAR, have introduced efficient point cloud data acquisition methods, bolstering precision and efficiency in calculating volumes for substantial irregular bodies. Notably, open-pit mines, characterized by their dynamic surface alterations, exemplify the challenges posed by large irregular bodies. Ensuring accurate excavation quantity calculations in such mines is pivotal, impacting operational considerations, acceptance, as well as production cost management and project oversight. Thus, this study employs UAV-acquired point cloud data from open-pit mines as a case study. In practice, calculating volumes for substantial irregular bodies often relies on the point cloud slicing method. However, this approach grapples with distinguishing multi-contour boundaries, leading to inaccuracies. To surmount this hurdle, this paper introduces an enhanced point cloud slicing method. The methodology involves segmenting point cloud data at fixed intervals, followed by the segmentation of slice contours using the Euclidean clustering method. Subsequently, the concave hull algorithm extracts the contour polygons of each slice. The final volume calculation involves multiplying the area of each polygon by the spacing and aggregating these products. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we employ model-derived volumes as benchmarks, comparing errors arising from both the traditional slicing method and our proposed technique. Experimental outcomes underscore the superiority of our point cloud volume calculation method, manifesting in an average relative error of 1.17%, outperforming the conventional point cloud slicing method in terms of accuracy.},

This work is motivated by the need to develop perception systems that must operate where dust is present. This paper shows that the behavior of measurements from the sensor is systematic and predictable. LiDAR sensors exhibit four behaviors that are articulated and understood from the perspective of the shape-of-return signals from emitted light pulses. We subject the commercial sensor to a series of tests that measure the return pulses and show that they are consistent with theoretical predictions of behavior. Several important conclusions emerge: (i) where LiDAR measures dust, it does so to the leading edge of a dust cloud rather than as a random noise; (ii) dust starts to affect measurements when the atmospheric transmittance is less than 71\% - 74\%, but this is quite variable with conditions; (iii) LiDAR is capable of ranging to a target in dust clouds with transmittance as low as 2\% if the target is retroreflective and 6\% if it is of low reflectivity; (iv) the effects of airborne particulates such as dust are less evident in the far field. The significance of this paper lies in providing insight into how better to use measurements from off-the-shelf LiDAR sensors in solving perception problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Point clouds obtained with 3D scanners or by image-based reconstruction techniques are often corrupted with significant amount of noise and outliers. Traditional methods for point cloud denoising largely rely on local surface fitting (e.g. jets or MLS surfaces), local or non-local averaging or on statistical assumptions about the underlying noise model. In contrast, we develop a simple data-driven method for removing outliers and reducing noise in unordered point clouds. We base our approach on a deep learning architecture adapted from PCPNet, which was recently proposed for estimating local 3D shape properties in point clouds. Our method first classifies and discards outlier samples, and then estimates correction vectors that project noisy points onto the original clean surfaces. The approach is efficient and robust to varying amounts of noise and outliers, while being able to handle large densely sampled point clouds. In our extensive evaluation, both on synthetic and real data, we show an increased robustness to strong noise levels compared to various state-of-the-art methods, enabling accurate surface reconstruction from extremely noisy real data obtained by range scans. Finally, the simplicity and universality of our approach makes it very easy to integrate in any existing geometry processing pipeline. Both the code and pre-trained networks can be found on the project page (https://github.com/mrakotosaon/pointcleannet).},

This research proposes to use open source point cloud library (PCL) for 3D segmentation of LiDAR point cloud and presents a novel histogram based methodology to separate the building clusters from the non building clusters. The proposed methodology has been applied on two different airborne LiDAR datasets acquired over part of urban region around Niagara Falls, Canada and southern Washington, USA. An overall building detection accuracy of 100% and 82% respectively is achieved for the two datasets. The performance of proposed methodology has been compared with the commercially available Terrasolid software. The results show that the buildings detected using open source point cloud library produce comparable results with the buildings detected using commercial software (buildings detection accuracy: 86.3% and 89.2% respectively for the two datasets).}

The prediction accuracy was evaluated by comparing the predicted data with ground truth data. We combined the ANN model with the genetic algorithm (GA) to improve the prediction accuracy and establish efficient sensor installation positions and number to proceed with optimization. Simulation results demonstrated that the best predictive performance (up to 97% accuracy) was achieved when the ANN structure was 9-19-19-1.

Not to be confused with a library, it is a software ecosystem (the concept of an operating system might be too strong) facilitating the integration, maintenance, and deployment of new functionalities and hardware from simulations to physical deployment.},

  abstract  = {Airborne particles such as dust, smoke and fog have a significant detrimental impact on Lidar- based robotic perception systems. Lidar rays can reflect on these particles, leading modern perception methods to erroneous results, such as false obstacles or misclassified elements. We propose a method to detect airborne particles in 3D Lidar point clouds using classification from geometric features and Lidar intensity re- turns. We compare three different classifiers and evaluate our approach on dust and fog data collected in outdoor scenarios. We achieve an accuracy of up to 95\% in detecting airborne particles in Lidar point clouds, making our pro- posed method a promising solution for appli- cations such as obstacle detection and object recognition in outdoor environments. We make available the code and data for this work at https://leo-stan.github.io/particles detection.}

  abstract  = {LiDAR sensors have been very popular in robotics due to their ability to provide accurate range measurements and their robustness to lighting conditions. However, their sensitivity to airborne particles such as dust or fog can lead to perception algorithm failures (e.g., the detection of false obstacles by field robots). In this work, we address this problem by proposing methods to classify airborne particles in LiDAR data. We propose and compare two deep learning approaches, the first is based on voxel-wise classification, while the second is based on point-wise classification. We also study the impact of different combinations of input features extracted from LiDAR data, including the use of multi-echo returns as a classification feature. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on a realistic dataset with the presence of fog and dust particles in outdoor scenes. We achieve an F1 score of 94{\%} for the classification of airborne particles in LiDAR point clouds, thereby significantly outperforming the state of the art. We show the practical significance of this work on two real-world use cases: a relative pose estimation task using point cloud matching, and an obstacle detection task. The code and dataset used for this work are available online.},

  abstract       = {Usually, substantial part of a mine haulage system is based on belt conveyors. Reliability of such system is significant in terms of mining operation continuity and profitability. Numerous methods for conveyor belt monitoring have been developed, although many of them require physical presence of the monitoring staff in the dangerous environment. In this paper, a remote sensing method for assessing a conveyor belt condition using the Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) system has been described. For this purpose a methodology of semi-automatic processing of point cloud data for obtaining the belt geometry has been developed. The sample data has been collected in a test laboratory and processed with the proposed algorithms. Damaged belt surface areas have been successfully identified and edge defects were investigated. The proposed non-destructive testing methodology has been found to be suitable for monitoring the general condition of the conveyor belt and could be exceptionally successful and cost-effective if combined with an unmanned, robotic inspection system.},

  abstract = {3D point cloud data obtained from laser scans, images, and videos are able to provide accurate and fast records of the 3D geometries of construction-related objects. Thus, the construction industry has been using point cloud data for a variety of purposes including 3D model reconstruction, geometry quality inspection, construction progress tracking, etc. Although a number of studies have been reported on applying point cloud data for the construction industry in the recent decades, there has not been any systematic review that summaries these applications and points out the research gaps and future research directions. This paper, therefore, aims to provide a thorough review on the applications of 3D point cloud data in the construction industry and to provide recommendations on future research directions in this area. A total of 197 research papers were collected in this study through a two-fold literature search, which were published within a fifteen-year period from 2004 to 2018. Based on the collected papers, applications of 3D point cloud data in the construction industry are reviewed according to three categories including (1) 3D model reconstruction, (2) geometry quality inspection, and (3) other applications. Following the literature review, this paper discusses on the acquisition and processing of point cloud data, particularly focusing on how to properly perform data acquisition and processing to fulfill the needs of the intended construction applications. Specifically, the determination of required point cloud data quality and the determination of data acquisition parameters are discussed with regard to data acquisition, and the extraction and utilization of semantic information and the platforms for data visualization and processing are discussed with regard to data processing. Based on the review of applications and the following discussions, research gaps and future research directions are recommended including (1) application-oriented data acquisition, (2) semantic enrichment for as-is BIM, (3) geometry quality inspection in fabrication phase, and (4) real-time visualization and processing.}

Due to these advantages, the construction industry has been capturing 3D point cloud data of construction sites, construction works, and construction equipment to enable better decision making in construction project management. The captured point cloud data are utilized to reconstruct 3D building models, check construction quality, monitor construction progress, improve construction safety etc. throughout the project lifecycle from design to construction and facilities management phase. This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art methods to acquire and process 3D point cloud data for construction applications. The different approaches to 3D point cloud data acquisition are reviewed and compared including 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, videogrammetry, RGB-D camera, and stereo camera. Furthermore, the processing methods of 3D point cloud data are reviewed according to the four common processing procedures including (1) data cleansing, (2) data registration, (3) data segmentation, and (4) object recognition. For each processing procedure, the different processing methods and algorithms are compared and discussed in detail, which provides a useful guidance to both researchers and industry practitioners for adopting point cloud data in the construction industry.},

  abstract  = {In the modern market of agricultural products, there is an acute problem of saturation of the grain sector of quality raw materials that are used in different spheres of production. There is annual expanding of the range of exports and increase in the volume, as well as growing consumption in the domestic market. To perform these tasks we need an efficient post-harvest processing and storage of grain raw materials. JSC “Novospassky Elevator” is a dynamically developing enterprise actively introducing modern technologies of processing and aeration of the grain mass to maintain and improve quality. Ventilation systems are used when drying grains in dryers. Aeration has a significant efficacy, however, drawbacks are a significant outlay of time, the changing weather conditions can be critical. The most perspective processing method is the intermittent ventilation, which has proved itself in the industry of bakery products and which can be performed in storage, being equipped with installations for active aeration, silos and bunkers. The authors developed a nomogram for selection of a rational mode of intermittent ventilation and its duration when the seed moisture content from 16% to 20% inclusively. The essence of intermittent aeration of grains is the use of short periods of blowing, which alternate with longer periods of binning the grains. During binning, the moisture from the inner layers flows into the outer, and, if subsequent ventilation is removed. In addition to the technology of intermittent aeration, the grains can also be stored using the method of storage in controlled atmosphere. Rational use of energy resources significantly reduces the cost of the enterprise.}

  abstract       = {For a rotating 2D lidar, the inaccurate matching between the 2D lidar and the motor is an important error resource of the 3D point cloud, where the error is shown both in shape and attitude. Existing methods need to measure the angle position of the motor shaft in real time to synchronize the 2D lidar data and the motor shaft angle. However, the sensor used for measurement is usually expensive, which can increase the cost. Therefore, we propose a low-cost method to calibrate the matching error between the 2D lidar and the motor, without using an angular sensor. First, the sequence between the motor and the 2D lidar is optimized to eliminate the shape error of the 3D point cloud. Next, we eliminate the attitude error with uncertainty of the 3D point cloud by installing a triangular plate on the prototype. Finally, the Levenberg–Marquardt method is used to calibrate the installation error of the triangular plate. Experiments verified that the accuracy of our method can meet the requirements of the 3D mapping of indoor autonomous mobile robots. While we use a 2D lidar Hokuyo UST-10LX with an accuracy of ±40 mm in our prototype, we can limit the mapping error within ±50 mm when the distance is no more than 2.2996 m for a 1 s scan (mode 1), and we can limit the mapping error within ±50 mm at the measuring range 10 m for a 16 s scan (mode 7). Our method can reduce the cost while the accuracy is ensured, which can make a rotating 2D lidar cheaper.},
